    <p>Here is a quote from WWF's website:</p>
    <!--blockquote just indents the text, and the cite attribute is just for browsers, not visible on page-->
    <blockquote cite="http://www.worldwildlife.org/who/index.html">
      For more than 60 years, WWF has worked to help people and nature thrive.
      As the worldâ€™s leading conservation organization, WWF works in nearly 100
      countries. At every level, we collaborate with people around the world to
      develop and deliver innovative solutions that protect communities,
      wildlife, and the places in which they live.
